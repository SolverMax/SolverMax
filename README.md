## About Solver Max

We're a collaborative group of professional modellers. Collectively we have several decades of experience in designing, building, and using optimization models. We want to share our experience with you.

### Objective

Our objective is to help you make better optimization models. We do this in two ways:
- Blog. Short items about optimization modelling and detailed optimization model examples.
- Services. A consulting service to work with you on improving your models.

### Purpose of this repository

The code for our optimization models, written in Excel or Python, is available here.

### Contact us

If you want help with your own models, or if you would like to know more about how to adapt any of our models to your needs, then please [contact us](https://www.solvermax.com/contact).
